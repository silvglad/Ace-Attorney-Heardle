# Ace Attorney Heardle

A Heardle clone application for the Ace Attorney franchise's soundtrack. 

- Based on the original [Heardle](https://www.heardle.app) website, where you guess a random song from its intro in as little tries as possible. Source code originally provided by [WJSN Heardle](https://github.com/jeroldcamacho/wjsn-heardle)
- *Used* to be [hosted](https://aceattorney-heardle.glitch.me) on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) back in 2022, where it amassed a fair amount of popularity and attention from the community surrounding the Ace Attorney games.
